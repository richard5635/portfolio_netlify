## Creation Process

#### Deciding the Gameplay and Algorithm

The main purpose of the content is to show the haptic feedback performance of LevioPole. The game was designed to frequently let the user feel the thrust from the drone. After a few brainstorming, kayaking was chosen since the act of pedaling allows frequent haptic feedback, and the dynamics of the sports itself keeps the player away from boredom.

#### Visual Design

I chose low poly mainly due to its simplicity, both in aesthetics and computing weight. With my 3DCG ability at that time, I also could not pursue photo-realism.

#### Hardware Communication

Leviopole gives haptic feedback through the propelling thrusts from the drones. Actuation signals are given from Unity when the pedal makes a contact with the water in the game. The pole in reality and physical realms are synchronized using HTC Vive's tracking devices, which is known to be easy to use and accurate.

#### Used Unity Assets

For prototyping speed, it is crucial to use existing assets and skipping unnecessary work. Below are the list of assets used in this work.

- SteamVR Plugin
- FREE Skybox - Cubemap Extended
- Level 1 Monster Pack
- Nature Pack (Extended)
- LowPoly Water
- Indian Canoe Malecite
