## Background

Leviopole's idea started from the increasing importance of force or haptic feedback for full-body interactions that is often involved for immersive Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality contents. This device gives the user mid-air haptic feedback, which removes the motion restriction if the device is mounted.

## Demo

During my involvement in the project, we made three VR demos for proof-of-concept. We used Unity to to make the demos, establishing serial communication with the IMU and microcontrollers mounted on the pole. Drop me a mail to hear more about how we built it, or you can also refer to the publication below.
