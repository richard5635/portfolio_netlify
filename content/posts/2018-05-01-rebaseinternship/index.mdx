## What I did

This internship gave me a first exposure to React, Redux, and Rails. Because of NDA, I will only disclose several technical challenges I faced during the internship. 

- Updating React contents based on scrum tickets
- Implementing components in the borderline of YAML and React
- Conditional component based on Rails' view, model, and controller
- Implementing lazy loading images
- Writing rake commands
- Responsive front-end markup based on UI design
- Debugging written code with chrome's react and redux devtools
- PostgreSQL database search

Please have a look at [their site](https://www.instabase.jp/) in case you are in Japan :)
