## Design Process

First I asked my clients about the theme of the party, since usually they would already have them planned at that point of time. Then I tried to match my visual design to the theme.
I also asked them what their favorite color was. That is why each card has a main color.
Within the period, I made designs for six people in total. I am not showing one of the six for privacy reasons.
