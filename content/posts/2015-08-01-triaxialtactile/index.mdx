subtitle: 'Prototyping and Circuit Design'
description: "Research project to develop a novel triaxial tactile sensor."
projectType: "School"
targetAudience: 'Target Audience'
dateDuration: 'April 2014 - August 2015'
myRole: 'Prototyping and Circuit Design'
myRoleDesc: "This project was led by Sophon Somlor, who was working on this as his Ph.D. thesis. I designed the circuit using Eagle, ordered the flexible circuit, and created testing tools using a 3D printer and milling machine. Alexander Schmitt acted as the supervisor for this project."
