Think! Think! is the free educational app to help improve your children’s thinking ‘sense’, their problem solving and critical thinking skills. Supervised by an elite team of education specialists in Japan, it has become Japan’s leading educational app for children, with over 50,000 active users.

## My Experience in Hanamaru Lab

Over the period of my internship, I implemented four games using Unity to be added to Think Think's collection. Some games I created were scrapped before being published, with only one available for view, which is the "Red-Blue Light."

Please feel free to drop me a mail to hear more about how I made the game :)
