targetAudience: 'Children using smartphones and tablets'
dateDuration: 'May 2017 until Apr 2018'
myRole: 'Unity Game Developer'
myRoleDesc: "I implemented several game designs using Unity for Hanamaru Labs educational app, Think-think. I interned there on a twelve hours per week basis. While receiving supervision from Naoki Kosaka and image resources, I implemented the games from scratch until they fully work. During my intern, I mainly used Unity's 2D Tools with minimum reliance on Physics Engine. "

Think! Think! is the free educational app to help improve your children’s thinking ‘sense’, their problem solving and critical thinking skills. Supervised by an elite team of education specialists in Japan, it has become Japan’s leading educational app for children, with over 50,000 active users.

## Games Developed
### Turnblocks
Turnblocks was my first game created using Unity. While receiving strict feedbacks and iteratively improving the game in its UX and scripts, I spent half a year to finish it. One of the main reason for the long development was my wrong decision to use Unity's 2D Physics Engine for animations. This causes blocks to get stuck during animations and causes unnecessary calculations. 
### SpotDiff
This game makes the player choose the different 3D block among three existing ones. I put an extra care in deciding the animation of the blocks and spotlight in order not to be too slow nor too fast for level progression. I was able to complete SpotDiff in a month.
### Red-BlueLight (赤青ライト)
This game makes the player look for the right path by tracing along nodes in a predetermined pattern. I find this trickier than SpotDiff to implement due to grid structures and interconnectivity between each node. Also, I had to implement animations which was new to me. It took me two months to finish this.
